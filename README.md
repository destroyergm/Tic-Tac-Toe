# Tic-tac-toe
This is my application for the OOP exercise in ruby.
The code is kind of messy, but it works as far as I've tested it. :)

# Instructions 
This was writen in Ruby, to play it you need Ruby installed on your system.
The main function is in game.rb, to play just run Ruby main.rb
To play a turn enter 1-9, depending on the cell you want to place your mark on.
